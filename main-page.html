The haphazardly arranged documentation for Cheesed Up's mod loader.<br>
<br>
Cheesed Up has a simple mod loader of its own now.<br>
That means you can have one or more community-made mods installed.<br>
<br>
They're toggleable in the settings:<br>
<img src="mod-menu.png"><br>
<br>
Mods are placed in the "mods" folder next to the .exe:<br>
<mark>CheesyPizza/mods/&ltmod&gt</mark><br>
<br>
If you're a little experienced with GameMaker, you can add simple stuff into the mod very easily.<br>
The API can do basic characters without GML coding, but you'll still need some form of programming knowledge.<br>
<br>
Prepare. You're gonna be dealing with a lot of JSON files.<br>
