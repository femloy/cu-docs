<h1>static</h1>
In GML code, you can use static variables.<br>
<pre><code class="language-gml">static counter = 0; // Only happens once
counter += 1; // Will keep increasing every time this code runs
</code></pre>
These are localized to each GML file - you can't share them.<br>
<br>
BUT.<br>
<br>
For some reason, this is kind of unreliable.<br>
If you try to set it to a more complex value, like a struct, <em>it will throw an error.</em><br>
<br>
Here's a workaround for that:
<pre><code class="language-gml">static s = undefined; // Won't crash

if s == undefined
    s = {}; // Works, but it's ugly. It is what it is
</code></pre>
This is a GMLive bug.
