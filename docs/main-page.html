The haphazardly arranged documentation for Cheesed Up's mod loader.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://discord.gg/thenoise">Cheesed Up</a> has a simple mod loader of its own now.<br>
That means you can have one or more community-made mods installed.<br>
<br>
They're toggleable in the settings:<br>

<br>
Mods are placed in the "mods" folder next to the .exe:<br>
<mark>CheesyPizza/mods/&ltmod&gt</mark><br>
<br>
If you're a little experienced with GameMaker, you can add simple stuff into the mod very easily.<br>
The API can do basic characters without GML coding, but you'll still need some form of programming knowledge.<br>
<br>
Prepare. You're gonna be dealing with a lot of JSON files.<br>

<h2>What about Pizza Oven?</h2>
Oven mods only work with the base game, not Cheesed Up, or any other mod at that.<br>
With Oven you can only load one mod at a time because all it does is patch the data.win.<br>
<br>
Cheesed Up's mod loader is more like Minecraft mod loaders.<br>
It's less powerful than editing the game directly, but you can mix and match mods.<br>
<span class="unimportant">And you don't have to deal with weird tools that only work half the time because the people making them only focus on jerking off and making schizophrenic theories about DELTARUNE.</span>
