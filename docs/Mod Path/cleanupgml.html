<h1>cleanup.gml</h1>
Runs when your mod is <em>disabled</em>.<br>
You should use this if your mod adds anything with code.<br>
<br>
Your mod doesn't exist anymore when it's disabled, but that stuff lingers.<br>
If you don't deal with that, the game could have a memory leak or even crash.<br>
<br>
Custom sprites and objects are handled automatically, but it's good practice to delete them yourself.

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-gml">sprite_delete(global.spr_icon);</code></pre>
This deletes the sprite previously created in <mark>init.gml</mark>.
