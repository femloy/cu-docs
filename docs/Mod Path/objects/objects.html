<h1>objects</h1>
You can add custom objects with the events you need.<br>
<br>
You can name your objects whatever you want, without spaces or special characters, except underscores.<br>
The object name is the folder's name. So, the create event for <mark>obj_example</mark> would be at <mark>MOD_PATH/objects/obj_example/create.gml</mark>.<br>
<br>
All of the possible events are in the <mark>obj_example</mark> folder.<br>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-gml">instance_create(0, 0, obj_example);</code></pre>
This creates an instance of the custom <mark>obj_example</mark> object at the top left of the room.

<h2>__OBJECT</h2>
Instances of custom objects are actually just <mark>obj_mod_object</mark>, and they're identified with their <mark>__OBJECT</mark> variable.<br>
<br>
That means you can't use <mark>object_index</mark> with them, so instead:

<pre><code class="language-gml">__OBJECT.name // Gets the name of the object as a string
__OBJECT.path // Gets the full directory path of the object as a string
</code></pre>
<br>

You also can't do <mark>with obj_example</mark>, but you can do this:
<pre><code class="language-gml">with obj_mod_object
{
    if __OBJECT != obj_example
        continue;
    // Do something with every obj_example
}
</code></pre>
<br>

And another example:
<pre><code class="language-gml">if other.object_index != obj_example
// WRONG

if !(other.object_index == obj_mod_object && other.__OBJECT == obj_example)
// Unfortunately correct
</code></pre>
<br>
No easier way to handle this I'm afraid. Mod loaders are hard.<br>
Also I have no idea what happens if you change __OBJECT. So don't do that.
